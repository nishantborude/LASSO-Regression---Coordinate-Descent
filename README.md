My work on building machine learning models for predictive analysis.

So far, I have worked on building Linear Regression, LASSO Regression, Support Vector Machines using the vectorized implementation.

## LASSO Regression

The data for LASSO regression is in the train_LASSO folder, do change the path of the files in the actual code.

## Linear Regresson

LASSO can be modified to Linear Regression simply by setting the lambda parameter as 0 in the code.

## Support Vector Machines
